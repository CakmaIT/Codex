# Codex Session Log

## 2025-10-08 â€” Repository Survey

### Summary
- Offline WPF classroom orchestration suite targeting dual-monitor setups; presentation layer uses MVVM with teacher dashboard and projector surfaces wired through `TeacherDashboardWindow` and `ProjectorWindow`.
- Application bootstraps via `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` inside `App.xaml.cs`, layering Serilog logging, configuration from `appsettings.json`/env vars, and DI registrations for state, services, and windows.
- `AppInitializationHostedService` seeds `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Ozge2` folders, provisions embedded tessdata, applies EF Core migrations, seeds sample data, and hydrates immutable `AppState` for the UI.
- Shared state flows through `AppStateStore` + `AppStateChangedMessage` (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm). Teacher/projector view-models subscribe and update UI collections on the dispatcher.
- `ProjectorWindowManager` controls dual-screen placement, fullscreen toggles, and overlays for freeze/reveal. Default target is the first non-primary monitor reported by `DisplayService`.
- Data layer: EF Core `OzgeDbContext` with rich domain entities (Class, Group, Unit, Question, etc.), seeded demo data via `DataSeeder`, and connection configuration provided by `OzgeDbContextFactory`.
- Quiz scaffolding: `QuizSessionService` loads unit questions, normalizes multiple-choice options, and returns `QuizSessionData`; UI view models currently expose `QuizQuestions` collections for future expansion.
- OCR pipeline (`Ozge.Ocr/OcrPipeline`) supports PDF (PdfPig), image (Tesseract), and plain text ingestion, generating representative vocabulary/questions and surfacing diagnostics; relies on provisioned tessdata assets.

### Observations / Follow-Ups
- Projector display selection UI is still pending despite service support; future enhancement opportunity.
- Background job handling is stubbed with `NullJobQueue`; real worker implementation can replace it when asynchronous tasks are introduced.
- Placeholder tessdata (`eng.traineddata`) should be swapped with the full language file for production accuracy.
- Upcoming feature ideas noted in README: richer game modes, analytics exports, persistent projector selection, robust content ingestion heuristics.

## 2025-10-08 - Quiz Feature Implementation

### Summary
- Wired `IQuizSessionService` into DI and refreshed initialization helpers to keep unit metadata clean, enabling quiz state loading from EF Core via the existing question data.
- Extended `TeacherDashboardViewModel` with quiz lifecycle commands (start/advance/end), state synchronization, and detailed observable properties backing the new WPF controls.
- Rebuilt `TeacherDashboardWindow` layout to surface unit selection, quiz status, current question preview, and full quiz outline alongside existing class controls.
- Updated `ProjectorViewModel` and `ProjectorWindow` to render quiz prompts, progress, and answer highlights driven by shared app state while retaining freeze/reveal overlays.
- Normalized legacy files with literal `\n` artifacts, ensuring compilable sources and reran `dotnet build` (succeeds with existing third-party package compatibility warnings).

### Follow-Ups
- Consider persisting quiz progress/history once gameplay modes expand (currently resets when class/unit changes).
- Visual styling can be refined (e.g., responsive layouts, accent colors) once projector UI is validated on dual-screen hardware.
